# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the project was to collect, analyze, and visualize weather data to help users choose their destinations based on their weather preference. As a result, an interactive tool was created that asked the user to input their maximum and minimum weather preferences and based on these choices a list of hotels was created that matched the selected parameters. Furthermore, in the final phase of this project an itinerary was created that suggested a trip in Brazil that had 4 stops from the list of the hotels created in the previous step.
